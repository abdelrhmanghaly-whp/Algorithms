# Binary Search
<b>Binary search</b> is a searching algorithm, it's main idea constructed from <b>divide & conquer algorithm</b>.
<br><br>
The parameter takes (list,requiredNumber) as a input, if the input doesn't exist it return a null value, but if the input is found it return it's <b>index</b>.
<br><br>
Binary Search is a perfect algorithm for <b>sorted</b> lists.
<br><br>
Space complexity for the Binary Search is <b>O(1)</b>.
<br><br>
Time complexity in the worst case scenario is <b>O(log n)</b>, it's applied if the required number at either extremity of the list or the required number is not in the list.
<br><br>
Best case scenario would be <b>O(1)</b> if the mid value is equal to the required value.
