## What is the circular Queue?
* it's a <b>Data Structure</b>, a normal Queue with a fixed size, thats why it called a circular queue or sometimes it's called a <b>Ring Buffer Queue</b>.
* a circular Queue is a connected <b>Ring</b>, so it's <b>first</b> element is connected with it's <b>last</b> element.
* it uses the same Queue princple <b>First in First out</b> or as it called <b>FIFO</b>
## Why is a circular Queue used?
* <b>circular Queue</b> offers a quick and clean way to store <b>FIFO</b> data with a <b>maximum size</b>.
* More efficiency in memory than a <b>Linear Queue</b> that keeps expanding if input <b>outpaces</b> output
## Types of Queues?
* <b>Normal Queue</b> --> Also called <b>I/O restricted Queue</b>.
* <b>Circual Queue</b> --> The one we mentioned.
* <b>Double Ended Queue</b> --> also called <b>Deque</b>, it's mostly used in competitive programming.
* <b>Priority Queue</b> --> Ascending/Descending Priority 
## Operations and complexity?
* The normal <b>Data Structures</b> operations which can <b>add/remove</b> Elements, and also a <b>Size Calculation</b>.
* <b>Time Complexity</b> for each operation is <b>O(1)</b>.
