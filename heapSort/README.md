## Heap Sort
* <b>Heap Sort</b> is one of my favorite algorithms that uses <b>comparison based</b> sorting method.
* <b>Comparison based</b> method is finding the minimum value and placing it at the top of the list, repeating the method for every value.
* <b>Heap Sort</b> is an <b>in-place</b> algorithm, which means it doesn't use auxiliary storage in the memory, it keeps replacing elements until the container is listed.
* We can say that the <b>Heap Sort</b> is a <b>Selection sort Algorithm</b> clone based on the same working techniques.
## How a Heap Sort works?
Before using the algorithm, you need to prepare the list first, How to prepare it?
By turning into the <b>max healp</b>, after that <b>swapping first value of the container with the last value</b>
shifting the new first value in the heap position after decreasing the range of values.
## What is Heap Sort used for?
* Spanning trees.
* Statistics (complex instant values).
* Data compression.
## Time & Space Complexity?
* Time Complexity is <b>O(n*log(n))</b>.
* Space Complexity is <b>O(1)</b> because it's an <b>in-place</b> algorithm as i have mentioned before.
