## What is a Binary Tree?
<b>Binary Tree</b> is defined as a tree data structure where each node has at most 2 children
Thats why we typically name them the left and right child for each <b>parent</b>

## Binary Tree Representation
<b>Binary Tree</b> is mostly represented with pointers, a pointer for the topmost node which called <b>Root</b>
a pointer for each <b>child</b> The left and the right, also a <b>Value</b>, and all these things are a <b>Node</b> representation

## What can i do with the Binary Tree?
You can do the following operations:
   * Insert Elements
   * Remove Elements
   * Searching for Elements
   * Traversing the tree (In-order Traversal, Pre-order Traversal, Post-order Traversal)
 
 You can also perform a helping methods, such as:
   * Find the node level
   * Find the tree size
   * Find the tree height

## Which type did i made?
I made a Post-order Traversal tree, using only the insertion method

## in Which cases i can use the Binary Tree?
   * Check if a Binary tree is a Sum tree
   * Check if two nodes are Cousins
   * Succinct Encoding of Binary Tree
   * Check if two trees are Mirror
   * Check if you can flip a the tree
   * Finding Subtrees ex: larget Subtree Sum
