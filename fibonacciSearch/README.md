# Fibonacci Search

* <b>Fibonacci Search</b> is a searching algorithm, it's main idea built on <b>Divide & conquer algorithm</b>.
* The parameter takes (list,requiredNumber) as a input, if the input doesn't exist it return a wasn't found as a string, but if the input is found it return it's <b>index</b>.
* <b>Fibonacci Search</b> is a good algorithm for <b>sorted</b> lists.
* <b>Fibonacci Search</b> examines relatively closer elements in subsequent steps.
* difference between <b>Fibonacci Search</b> and <b>Binary Search</b>, that <b>Fibonacci</b> divides given list into unequal parts
* Time Complexity for the <b>Fibonacci Search</b> is <b>O(nlogn)</b>.
